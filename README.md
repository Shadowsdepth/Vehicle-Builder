# Vehicle-Builder

## Description

I wanted to be able to Create or use existing vehicles to do certain things like just drive around, tow, or do a wheelie
And if it wasnt the correct type of vehicle it would'nt be able to do certain things such as a car not being able to do a wheelie
I learned how to make classes combine such as the cars, trucks, and motorbikes under the vehicles class since thats how they're all related
